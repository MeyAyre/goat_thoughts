# Goat Thoughts
Goat Thoughts is an Android app designed to help everyone from clients in therapy to patients seeing their doctors log and organize their thoughts in-between sessions.


## How it works
Simply add a provider, add an upcoming session, and start logging your Thoughts for the next time you see your provider. 

## Why Goat Thoughts?
Have you ever: 
- Gone to an appointment you were looking forward to, but forgot everything you wanted to say as soon as 
you sat down?

- Tried keeping a list with everything you want to bring up, but lost or forgot it by the time you got to your appointment?

Goat Thoughts is an aid to keep your thoughts and concerns on track so you can get the most out of your appointment.

## Who made this?

Goat Thoughts was created as a capstone project for Cascadia College's MOBAS program.
